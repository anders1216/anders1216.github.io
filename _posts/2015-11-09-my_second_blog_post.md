title: My Second Blog Post!!
---

Im writing a second blog post about blogs. What are those!!!?!?! (I admit thats a little old now). but seriouslym since when did people start post their journals online.
it seems a little rediculous to me you know. What ever happened to intelectual freedom and secutiry. Does no one realise that writing somthing under the 
pressure of watching eyes, present or not, imagined or real, narrows your thoughts, confines your desires and restricts your growth. As if the idea of the NSA 
or Big brother wasn't enough, now we willingly place these confines on ourselves. But not all blogs are journals and thats cool. I can agree with the idea of
a blog hub as the current pub. a meeting place for intelectual conference. I can dig that but people be wary your thoughts are your own and if you dont know that
make a place that you can at least believe it.
