title: My thoughts on Version C0nt12o1
---

Version control is very useful...I just dont know how or why. To explain further I should first iterate that I dont have much exepreince with coding in any form.
From here I want to direct you to the idea that I rarely use version control. Its a habit im trying to form but at the moment its not more then a budon my rose stem.
I want to explain my self as well. I have little need for version control so far but I can already see how it can be useful so why am i not using it?
Im not using it cause git feels cluncky and finicky conpared to the smooth stable github. Im used to pointers that physically point and words that have been 
collectively agreed upon. Not that theres anything wrong with those that arnt but im not used to them yet. I mean im aware rome wasnt built ina  day and I 
like to think that im a little more complex then an ancient metropolis although a little less cutlured. so you know I think Git and its hub is very useful
but I need to get used to it.
